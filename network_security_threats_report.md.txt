Task 3: Research Report on Common Network Security Threats
Introduction

With the rapid growth of digital communication and internet-based services, network security has become a critical concern for organizations and individuals. Cyber attackers continuously exploit vulnerabilities in networks to disrupt services, steal sensitive information, or gain unauthorized access. This report discusses some of the most common network security threats, explains how they work, their impact, real-world relevance, and the preventive measures that can be taken to reduce risks.

1. Denial of Service (DoS) Attack

A Denial of Service (DoS) attack is a cyberattack designed to make a system, server, or network unavailable to legitimate users by overwhelming it with excessive traffic or requests.

How It Works

In a DoS attack, the attacker sends a large number of requests to a target system within a short period. The system becomes overloaded and cannot respond to genuine user requests. In some cases, multiple compromised systems are used to launch the attack, known as a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.

Impact

Website or service downtime

Financial losses due to service disruption

Loss of customer trust and reputation

Increased operational costs

Real-World Example

Several large organizations and online platforms have experienced outages due to massive DDoS attacks, temporarily disabling their services.

Prevention and Mitigation

Use of firewalls and intrusion detection systems

Rate limiting and traffic filtering

Load balancing and traffic monitoring

Using DDoS protection services

2. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack

A Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack occurs when an attacker secretly intercepts and possibly alters the communication between two parties who believe they are directly communicating with each other.

How It Works

The attacker positions themselves between the sender and receiver. They can eavesdrop on the communication, capture sensitive data such as login credentials, or modify the data being transmitted without the knowledge of either party.

Impact

Theft of sensitive information

Compromise of user credentials

Data manipulation

Privacy breaches

Real-World Example

MITM attacks are commonly seen on unsecured public Wi-Fi networks, where attackers intercept data transmitted by users.

Prevention and Mitigation

Use of HTTPS and SSL/TLS encryption

Avoiding unsecured public Wi-Fi networks

Using Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)

Implementing strong authentication mechanisms

3. IP Spoofing

IP spoofing is a technique where an attacker falsifies the source IP address of network packets to hide their identity or impersonate another system.

How It Works

The attacker modifies packet headers to make them appear as if they are coming from a trusted source. This technique is often used to bypass security measures or to assist in other attacks such as DoS attacks.

Impact

Unauthorized access to systems

Bypassing firewall rules

Increased difficulty in tracing attackers

Facilitation of other cyberattacks

Real-World Example

IP spoofing is frequently used in large-scale network attacks to hide the true origin of malicious traffic.

Prevention and Mitigation

Packet filtering at routers and firewalls

Network authentication protocols

Ingress and egress filtering

Monitoring abnormal traffic patterns

Importance of Network Security

Network security is essential to protect data, maintain system availability, and ensure trust in digital services. Understanding common threats allows organizations to implement effective security controls, reduce vulnerabilities, and respond quickly to incidents.

Conclusion

Network security threats such as DoS attacks, MITM attacks, and IP spoofing pose serious risks to modern digital environments. By understanding how these attacks operate and applying proper security measures, organizations and individuals can significantly reduce the likelihood of successful attacks. Continuous monitoring, security awareness, and proactive defense strategies are key to maintaining a secure network infrastructure
